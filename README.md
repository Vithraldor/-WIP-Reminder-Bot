# -WIP-Reminder-Bot

This is a Discord bot designed for personal use.

Each day, a member is designated to ask a question to the entire server. This bot is designed to ping a user when it's their assigned day to ask a question, notifying them of
their commitment. This can be sent to a channel of the user's choice (editable in source code) and is done at midnight EST.

In addition to this, the bot also sends a message every hour reminding people to drink water. This can also be sent to a channel of the user's choice (also editable in
source code.

This is currently a work in progress! I have not yet implemented the midnight ping function. In its current state, the bot pings a user upon launch and waits 24 hours
before pinging the next user.
